            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Math PHD student in the <a href="https://auburn.edu/cosam/departments/math/"><abbr title="Department of Mathematics and Statistics">DMS</abbr></a> at Auburn University. I obtained my Master of Science in Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/">University of South Alabama</a>, where I earned my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering 
                and Mathematics with a concentration in Aerospace Engineering in 2023. My research interests currently lie in graph theory and combinatorial game theory. Outside of mathematics, I enjoy camping, tabletop games, and swimming. I also enjoy assisting in math outreach. I currently serve on the steering committee of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jrmf-cmc/">JRMF Community Math Circle</a>.</p>
