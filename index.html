                        <p>
                            I am a second year Mathematics PhD student in the <a href="https://auburn.edu/cosam/departments/math/">Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a> at Auburn University.
                            I obtained my Master of Science in Mathematics in 2024 at the <a href="https://www.southalabama.edu/">University of South Alabama</a>, where I
                            earned my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics with a concentration in Aerospace Engineering in 2023.
                            My research interests currently lie in discrete math: graph theory, discrete geometry, and combinatorial game theory.
                            Outside of mathematics, I enjoy camping, tabletop games, and swimming.
                            I also enjoy assisting in math outreach.
                            I am currently serving on the steering committee of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jrmf-cmc/">JRMF Community Math Circle</a>
