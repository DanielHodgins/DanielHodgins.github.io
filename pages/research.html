        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Minimizing the lengths of connections in network systems can be useful in the
            real world when connections are cost prohibitive. In this paper, we define a function
            called the edge sum to evaluate embeddings of graphs on the square grid. The edge
            sum is determined by the lengths of the edges in the taxicab metric. In addition, our
            objective is to find bounds on the minimum edge sum for various classes of graphs.
            We prove what graphs have embeddings on the 2 dimensional grid. We describe
            operations that can be done to reduce the lengths of edges in the taxicab metric.
            We found results for: paths, cycles, wheels, triangulations, prisms, and trees in the
            2 dimensional grid. We show results for complete graphs, wheel graphs, and trees in
            higher dimensional grids.
