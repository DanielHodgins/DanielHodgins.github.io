    <font color="green" size="+2">January</font>&nbsp; I started my last semester of my Master degree. Below is a picture of my friend Jessie visting from out of town. I created a cool necktie knot that formss a diagonal strip across the knot.<p>

    <font color="red" size="+2">February</font>&nbsp; I went to a Mardi Gras parade with some friends. Afterwards we went to Mo' Bay Beignet where some of my former students happen to also be there. During lent I volunteer with the fish frys for the Catholic student center and got to chat with a few friends. My classmate Brandon took a silly photo next to the window where we jokingly described it as the Grand Canyon.<p>

    <font color="green" size="+2">March</font>&nbsp; During the Spring Semester Alpha Hall East and Alpha Hall South were torn down to make way for the new Frederick P. Whiddon College of Medicine building. It was amazing watching the buildings be torn down, not often you get to see a hallway open up to the outdoors on a upper level. A few friends got togther during spring break, one of which made dinner which was very kind. I also sucessfully defended my thesis.<p>

    <font color="red" size="+2">April</font>&nbsp; I was very busy in April. I went to two conferences, visited Auburn, and traveled to see the eclipse. For the Math For All confernce I got to stay at The Eliza Jordan 4-star hotel and I gave a talk on my theis. I found a very good restraunt called Mother's Restraunt; they claim to have the world's best ham. I went to Troy Mathfest to give a talk and visited Auburn to talk to the graduate coordinator on the same weekend. I got to go to Hector, Arkansas with the Society of Physics Students and Honor College to see a total solar eclipse for the first time. It was so dark the night before the eclipse that I was able to take a photo of the Milky Way galaxy. I got to go to a Bridgerton theme tea tasting. At the Catholic student center, I was awarded an awrd for the most ambitious. The next day I hosted a game night with some friends. I got trap in an elevator at the library when I was on my way to study Abstract Algebra with some classmates. The Mobile Fire-Rescue Department sent a crew who manage to get the door open wide enough for me to get through. On the eclipse trip, we found a waterfall and we ate at a restraunt called the Purple Cow.<p>

    <font color="green" size="+2">May</font>&nbsp; I graduate and now have a master of science in mathematices. I went to the 33rd Cumberland Conference where I gave another talk on my thesis. I stayed at the Historic Hotel Chester and went to a local restraunt that had alligator nuggets. I went with my mom to view some apartments in Auburn and found a humorous sign at Buc-ee's. My friend Casey invited me to a graduation party at his grandfather's beach house. I played Betrayal at House on the Hill and got to use my bug net for the first time.<p>

    <font color="red" size="+2">June</font>&nbsp; I was a counselor at Camp M.A.S.H. with the green group. We had our first field trip, where we visited UMS Wright. Per tradition we went to Buffalo Wild Wings afterwards. Camp was amazing like usual. I worked with Grant to take care of six boys ages around 9 to 11. I got called up one night after dinner to particpate in a ball sorting game in which I won a gold medal that I gave to one of my campers.<p>

    <font color="green" size="+2">July</font>&nbsp; During the summer I got to work with Dr. Jeff Mudrock and five University of South Alabama students researching list coloring; we finnished up the research in July and shifted to writing up our research. I attended the graduation for my good friend Mary. I also found a friendly dragonfly in my backyard. This month ended up being mostly preparing for the move to Auburn.<p>
