slope@ change in y over change in x
secant line@ a line between any two points on the curve
tangent line@ a line that touches the curve at exactly one point
limit@ The ___ is of f(x) is the y-value the function approaches (gets really close but not necessarily equal to) as the x-value approaches a number $a$.
average rate of change@ the slope of a secant line
average velocity@ [v_{avg}] of a moving object is the average rate of change of its position [p(t_2) − p(t_1)] with respect to time [t_2 − t_1]
continuous@ you can draw the function without picking up your pencil
jump discontinuity@ occurs when there is a vertical gap between different parts of a function
one-sided limit@  is the y-value a function approaches as the x-value approaches a number $a$ from either the right or the left of a.
domain@  of a function is its set of allowed x-values
vertical asymptote@  a vertical line that the graph of a function is not allowed to touch. It corresponds to an x-value that is not in a function’s domain because it makes the function’s denominator zero.
infinite discontinuity@ another name for vertical asymptote
infinite limit@ means the y-value of a function either increases ($\infty$) or decreases ($−\infty$) without bound as the x-value approaches a number $a$.
horizontal asymptote@ a horizontal line that the graph of a function is not allowed to touch at very large values of x
limit at infinity@  means the y-value of a function approaches a number $L$ as the x-value either increases or decreases without bound
removable discontinuity@ On a graph, this is a hole.
piecewise function@  frequently requireone-sided limits as they are made up of multiple functions
absolute value function (piecewise def.)@ a piecewise function that outputs the magnitude of its input $|x|= x$ for $x \geq 0$ and $|x|=-x$ for $x<0$
rationalize@ to get rid of the radical in the numerator or denomenator by multiplying by a special (or fancy). For example, we could multiply by the conjugate over the conjugate
Squeeze Theorem@  If we can find two functions, one greater than and one less than our problem function, each with the same limit, our problem limit is forced to have the same value as the bounding limits.
verbal argument@  Since infinity is not a number, we can not use any of our previous methods for finding limits. To evaluate infinite limits, we will have to use a ______ ________, or words.
True Facts about limits of $\frac{1}{x^n}$ and $e^{±nx}$@ $\lim_{ \to \pm\infty}\frac{1}{x^n} = 0$ and $\lim_{ \to \pm\infty} e^{\mp nx} = 0$
Continuous (limit definition)@ if $f(a)$ and $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists and $f(a) = \lim_{x \to a} f(x)$
Continuous on an interval@ a function is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at all numbers contained in the interval
Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)@a function $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and $N$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Then there exists a number $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f(c) = N$
derivative@ the slope of the tangent line; the instantaneous rate of change at a point of the function
limit definition of derivative@ $f'(x)= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$
differentiable@if the derivate of the function exists then the function is ______________.
linear approximation@ A method of approximationg a function near a specific point using the equation of its tangent line at that point
linearization@ a local approximation of a function using the equation of the tangent line at some point.
