Attendence Policy(You must get the course content, you must show that YOU have master the content, I want to see you, and I want you to colloborate with your peers);
If you have to miss class due to family issues, field trip, illness, mental health day, or something else important: let me know before hand if possible or at least as early as possible,
          Only you know if something is important enough to miss class. If you miss, you can make up stuff through office hours or making an appointment
Late work: It takes time for me to grade assignments and I need to be able to give you the feedback of your assignments in a timely manner, thus I will assign a hard deadline
that will be announced that guarentees that your assignment will be graded; and there will be a softdeadline that I may or may not announce (which is when I finnish grading the assignment)
