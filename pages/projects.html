        <h2>My Personal Website</h2>
        <p>This webiste <a href="https://danielhodgins.github.io/">https://danielhodgins.github.io/</a> was originally started on the 26th of December 2022 as a simple markdown file based website; however, I invested a lot more time and effort to teach myself html in 2024. Therefore the current version of this website began on the 10th of April 2024 and have been evolving into what you are visiting today. So this website has been my sandbox to learn html which is the 2nd programing language that I have taught myself; the first being <span class="texhtml" style="font-family:'CMU Serif', cmr10, LMRoman10-Regular, 'Times New Roman', 'Nimbus Roman No9 L', Times, serif">L<span style="text-transform:uppercase;font-size:70%;margin-left:-0.36em;vertical-align:0.3em;line-height:0;margin-right:-0.15em">a</span>T<span style="text-transform:uppercase;margin-left:-0.1667em;vertical-align:-0.5ex;line-height:0;margin-right:-0.125em">e</span>X</span> which I had a lot more support learning it from various mentors including professors, classmates, and acquaintances at conferences that I have been to.</p>

        <h2>DBF Plane 2022-2023</h2>
        <p>The objective was to create an "electronic warfare" UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle). More specifically for the 2022-2023 academic year our objective was to design, build, and test an aircraft to execute electronic warfare (EW) missions.
            Flight missions will include staging of the aircraft, surveillance, and jamming.

            This was joint work with Logan Allen, Noah Broadus, Justin Dyer, and Landon Freeman. Our advisor for this capstone design project was Carlos Montalvo.

        <h2>Mockingbird-An Aquatic UAV drone</h2>
        <p>The Mockingbird is an UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) plane that could land and take off from water. The Mockingbird also has a very low "wing cube loading". A fun fact is that the fuselage of the Mockingbird is a salad bowl.</p>
